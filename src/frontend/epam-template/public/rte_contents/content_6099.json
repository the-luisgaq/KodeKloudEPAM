This means that the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility (to authorized persons) of personal information must be ensured. Confidentiality means that personal information can be accessed only by those authorized to use such information. Integrity means that the personal information must be accurate and adequate for the purpose for which it is processed. Accessibility means that authorized users must be able to access the personal information, if they need such information for the permitted purposes. Accordingly, EPAM ensures that appropriate measures are in place to protect the personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. EPAM complies with the above principles by applying adequate software and hardware security measures (including the monitoring of physical access and system access, locks, alarms, firewalls, etc.).
