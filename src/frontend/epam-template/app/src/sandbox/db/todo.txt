Layout and scrolling
[x] Lazy rows rendering (virtual scrolling)
    [x] Supporting arbitrary row-heights
[x] Horizontal scrolling
    [x] Fixed columns

Editing
[ ] Most input types supports mode='cell', to behave like editable cell
    [x] TextInput
    [ ] DatePicker
    [ ] PickerInput
    [x] TextArea

Performance
[ ] DB Indexes
    [x] Fast lookup by PK. E.g. for dictionary fields: Person.locationId would result db.locations.byId(person.locationID) for each row. Need O(log(N)) here.
    [ ] Fast lookup for many-to-many relations.

Filtering
[ ] All common filter types
    [x] MultiPicker for a single dictionary lookup (filter by person.departmentId)
        [ ] handle null-value in facet filters
    [ ] MultiPicker for a many-to-many relation
    [ ] DateRange filter
    [ ] Search
[ ] Extracting facets from data

Data Handling and Lazy Loading
[ ] Db - support lazy loading
[ ] Flat list lazy Loading
[ ] Hierarchical layer-by-layer loading (load all roots, load all children on unfolding)
    [ ] recursively
[ ] Hierarchical lazy loading (load top N roots, load top N children of unfolded roots)
    [ ] recursively

Customization
[ ] ColumnConfigDialog - configure visible columns and reorder them
[ ] Column reordering and resizing

Demo features
[ ] Huge data set
[ ] Many-to-many example
[ ] Extract helpers to make them re-usable
[ ] Toolbar
    [ ] Search
[ ] Footer
    [ ] Filterer/Unfiltered counts
