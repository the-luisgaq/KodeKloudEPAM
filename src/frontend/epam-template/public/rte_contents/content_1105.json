For instance, if you are working with your colleagues in an EPAM office all day, a more casual outfit (i.e. jeans, tennis shoes) is appropriate. However, if you’re hosting customers or other external people, plan to dress appropriately for their business, whether that is formal or informal, because it will affect impressions of both you and of EPAM. In all cases, you are expected to exercise judgment regarding what is appropriate for the workplace. \\\\r\\\",\\\"marks\\\":[]}]},{\\\"object\\\":\\\"block\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"paragraph\\\",\\\"data\\\":{},\\\"nodes\\\":[{\\\"object\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"If you are assigned to work at a client site, you are expected to dress in line with that client’s dress code.  \\\\r\\\",\\\"marks\\\":[]}]},{\\\"object\\\":\\\"block\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"paragraph\\\",\\\"data\\\":{},\\\"nodes\\\":[{\\\"object\\\":\\\"text\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"marks\\\":[]}]}]}}\""}
